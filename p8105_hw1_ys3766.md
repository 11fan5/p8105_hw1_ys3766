The purpose of this file is to present my work for Homework 1

## Problem 1

Load the penguins dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Inspect the dataset

``` r
view(penguins)
```

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
