```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

The purpose of this file is to present my work for Homework 1


## Problem 1

Load the penguins dataset
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Inspect the dataset
```{r}
view(penguins)
```

```{r}

ncol(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
